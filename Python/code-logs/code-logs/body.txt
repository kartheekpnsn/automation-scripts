Title: Code logs generation

Body:
First we need to create a code-logs directory
Then if body.txt doesn't exist we need to fill it with the basic template text
Once the user fills out the body.txt with the original content then he can re-run the gen-logs.py code
In the code it extracts title, body, files, to do from the body.txt file
It also creates a timestamp using datetime library in python
It sends all these as parameters to generate HTML file as logs
In that html file the title is used as Heading and others as paragraph and list elements
If the same work is done in different timestamp, the same file gets appended with the text.
Once all the work is done, the user can run close-logs.py where all the HTML files will be converted to PDF and then the HTML files gets deleted

Files:
gen-logs.py
close-logs.py

Links:
None

To Do:
try font weights in between body
try font colors
add url links used
